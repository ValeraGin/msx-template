This project was created as a template for a complete application for Media Station X.

This template shows how to organize the API and serve up your content in Media Station X. Also, a template for your site has been added right away. This template can be used for websites with their own movies.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValeraGin/msx-template.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

## IDE

I personally recommend to use either [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/ru-ru/webstorm/).

## Development server

To start the server, you need to run these commands in different terminals  
Run `npm run start-backend` for a backend-dev server.  
Run `npm run start-web` for a dev web-server.  
Run `npm run start-plugins` for a dev msx-server.  

http://localhost:4200/ - Angular (frontend web app)  
http://localhost:4200/api - NestJS (backend app)  
http://localhost:1234/ - Media Station X Plugins/Data (MSX Scripts)  

Test:
- 1 way: open msx.benzac.de and enter "localhost:4200"
- 2 way: open link http://msx.benzac.de/?start=menu:request:interaction:init@http://localhost:1234/index.html
