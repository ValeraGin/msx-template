# MSXPlayer

🚀 **version 0.0.1**

🌏 [English](README.md)

This project was created as a template for a complete application for Media Station X.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValeraGin/msx-template.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm install

## IDE

I personally recommend to use either [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/ru-ru/webstorm/).

## Development server

To start the server, you need to run these commands in different terminals  
Run `npm run start-backend` for a backend-dev server.  
Run `npm run start-web` for a dev web-server.  
Run `npm run start-msx` for a dev msx-server.  

http://localhost:4200/ - Angular (frontend web app)  
http://localhost:4200/msx - Media Station X (frontend msx app)  
http://localhost:4200/api - NestJS (backend app)
